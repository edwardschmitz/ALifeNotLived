    <h1>
        A Life Not Lived
    </h1>
    <p>Waking mid-morning, he opened his eyes to see his cat sitting on the edge of the bed. She stared at him expectantly. When she saw that his eyes were open, she instantly began crying for her breakfast. This was the most exciting part of her day, and she was eager to get it going. </p>
    She followed him to the kitchen, dashing around his feet like she was indestructible. As he was ready to dispense the prescribed amount of food, he discovered that her bowl wasn't even empty yet. Looking down at the cat, he wondered to himself, <i>why is she so excited.</i> She could’ve come here to eat at her leisure. He dumped the food in the bowl anyway. She began to eat. He gazed down at her shaking his head. </p>
    <p>He turned to the coffee maker and got the morning brew going. While the coffee maker worked diligently, he turned on the morning news. The program would continue in the background while he prepared some toast with jam. Then he sat himself down in front of the broadcast and began to eat, as well. </p>
    <p>It was all standard fare for a weekday morning. Even the weekends were the same except for which show he watched. </p>
    <p>On this particular day, the breaking news was that an elderly Asian woman had been assaulted by a stranger as she entered her building. The attack was brutal. It was random. And it was racially motivated. He was incensed by the incident. </p>
    <p>He sipped his coffee and listened as the details were revealed. He would often get charged up by whatever news story was airing. After all, it’s rage that sells, isn’t it? He had a tendency to unleash a torrent of obscenities if he was particularly bothered. </p>
    <p>The program ended, and his food was gone. He picked up the dishes and deposited them in the sink. With the water running down the drain, he casually washed everything. </p>
    <p>His mind was wandering and perhaps he was scrubbing each piece too thoroughly. That poor old woman. She didn’t deserve any of that. If he had been there, he would’ve dealt with this coward appropriately. </p>
    <p>He was now at the computer, getting ready for his first meeting of the day. He needed to make a presentation remotely to a client. This was typical as he always worked from home. The truth is, he rarely ever had any place to go. He would go out to exercise and go shopping. But there were plenty of days that he never left the house. He didn’t think of himself as shut in. It just worked out that way.</p>
    <p>Having finished the meeting, his thoughts began to drift again. He was remembering a little Chinese girl he knew once a very long time ago. He had not thought about her for years. It felt strange to recall her now. </p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><i>He could see himself as he was then. Just out of 8th grade. How old would that make him? He didn’t know. He was in a classroom seated at a table at the front of the class. It was the summer school session for the local elementary school. The table was next to the teacher’s desk, and he was the teacher’s aide. Surveying the room, the students were all 1st graders. They were good kids, if maybe a bit rowdy. </i></p>
    <p><i>Sitting in the front row and directly facing him was the little Chinese girl. She flashed him a smile and waved. Turning bright red, he averted his gaze. Why was she doing this, he thought. Everyone in the class knew she had a crush on him. She didn’t care. The students all made fun of them, but she wouldn’t stop. <i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>He snapped himself out of his daydream. He knew he needed to work. But no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to concentrate.</p>
    <p>What he needed was a fantastic meal, he decided. Being self-employed gave him the freedom to work when he wanted, or not. It was his choice.</p>
    <p>In the kitchen, he pulled out all the necessary ingredients and tools. He had a real passion for cooking and Italian was his favorite.</p>
    <p>He began with a large pot and got the water boiling. He added a generous pinch of salt while the water was heating up. Then he turned to slice up some bacon into small pieces. This he would fry in a large pan over medium heat. The target was extra-crispy and golden-brown bits.</p>
    <p>In a separate bowl, he whisked together some eggs and grated parmesan cheese until it formed a smooth mixture. He admired his deft hand. This mixture was set aside for later use.</p>
    <p>To the water he added a handful of spaghetti, having reached a rolling boil. <i>Al dente</i>, he thought. <i>Perfection.</i> He then drained the pasta and transferred it directly into the pan with the bacon. </p>
    <p><i>I’m on fire.</i></p>
    <p>He lowered the heat and let the pan cool slightly before adding in the egg and cheese mixture. It was crucial to stir the sauce swiftly to ensure that the pasta was coated evenly and the eggs were cooked through without being overdone.</p>
    <p>Finally, he plated the masterpiece. A garnish of black pepper and chopped parsley was the crowning touch. The dish looked amazing. It smelled even better. He poured a glass of Chianti, a 2017 vintage. </p>
    <p>He held the glass up to the light to examine the visual characteristics. He swirled it in the glass before thrusting his nose deep inside. Breathing in the aromatics, it was only then that he sipped the contents and rolled it around his mouth. <i>An excellent year.</i></p>
    <p>As he savored the rich flavor and creamy texture of the food, he broke into a smile. <i> How well it turned out.</i> </p>
    <p>He did enjoy the meal. And he was glad he was capable in the kitchen. He knew how to assemble a meal from raw ingredients that was both nutritious and tasty. But this was a distraction, and it was short lived. </p>
    <p>The kitchen was a mess. This was in tolerable. Working diligently, he got everything back in order. It was a mindless task which left his brain drifting.</p>
    <p>He began to wonder about that little girl again. He thought back to the day he had briefly met her mother.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><i>He walked toward the exit of the school. His head was in the clouds. Always daydreaming. Which is why he didn’t notice the little Chinese girl until she was right in front of him.</i></p>
    <p><i>She smiled up at him. He stopped abruptly. Noticing she was not alone he said hello to her mother. “你好”, She replied. He had no idea what she said. </i></p>
    <p><i>The little girl spoke up, “My mother says hello!” Ok, that cleared things up. He was very uncomfortable. He fidgeted. The discomfort must have been obvious because the two spoke in Chinese and giggled. He had a short conversation with her mother. She spoke Chinese while the girl translated. It was all pleasant enough, but he didn’t really want to be there. He was polite and said goodbye, then walked off. </i></p>
    <p><i>The girl ran after him and said that her mother had a request. “She wants to know if you will teach me better English.” He stood there with a blank look on his face. </p>
    <p><i> “I’ll think about it,” he said finally and walked away. </i></p>
    <p><i>He did, in fact, think about it. He thought about it all day. He thought about it all night. He thought about it in the morning. He thought about it while he skipped going to the class. The truth is, he never went back again. </i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>To this day he still thinks about this incident. He felt it was an embarrassment how he acted.</p>
    <p>As the day wore on, he felt the shame of that lurking. This was a recurring theme in his life. Something would trigger a thought from the past. It would involve a shameful act. He would obsess over it. Sometimes for hours. Sometimes for days. There were techniques he used to distract himself, such as the meal he had prepared earlier. But the thoughts often overtook him. And he would sink into despair.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>As the day wore on and the thoughts continued to plague him, he became consumed with guilt. He should’ve delt with things better. <i>Why did I blow off that request? </i>he thought. What was I so afraid of? </i></p>
    <p>As he descended into a pitiful mood, he started drinking early. His drinking chair absorbed the impact as he fell hard onto the seat. He rubbed the leather admiring the texture. It was well worn as fine leather should be. There was a certain amount of melancholy in that observation. </p>
    <p>He downed the first drink fast and poured another. His thoughts were chasing him, and drinking was his escape. <i>The liquor is working its magic, </i> he thought.</p>
    <p>But it didn’t take long before his mind was wandering again. His past failings were creeping up behind him and threatening a rear assault. </p>
    <p>He downed the second one and kept pouring. He was determined not to let his thoughts overtake him again tonight. </p>
    <p>But his strategy was flawed. The thoughts weren’t chasing him. They were a part of him. And the drinking only left him helpless to make sense of the phantoms lurking in the dark recesses of his mind. </p>
    <p>The next few drinks came and went fast. He kept pouring anyway. </p>
    <p>After a time, he found himself gazing at the light refracting through the clear glass and amber liquid. <i>I must be drunk now</i>, he thought. He wondered at the journey that the alcohol must have taken to arrive at this exact spot. <i>Yes, definitely drunk. </i> </p>
    <p>But the feeling of loss and failure wouldn’t leave him. </p>
    <p>As the night grew old and the bottle increasingly empty, he felt the fight drain out of him. He sunk further and further into the furniture. The room was starting to become difficult to discern. He attempted to reach for the glass in front of him. But instead, he knocked it over and the remaining contents spilled across the table. He slumped over sideways - his arm still extended. And the final bits of consciousness drained from his mind as he drifted off into a dream. </p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><i>As he looked around the classroom, he felt a sense of familiarity wash over him. The room was the same as always, yet it seemed different. The colors were brighter, and the air was fresher. The students sat quietly at their desks, listening intently to the teacher. He watched as the little Chinese girl, sitting in the front row, absorbed the lesson with the quiet innocence of a child. </i></p>
    <p><i>Everything shifted and he found himself standing outside the school. The children were leaving for the day. The little Chinese girl approached him with her mother. The mother greeted him in Chinese, "你好" She was an attractive woman of slight build, with long black hair and dark eyes. A widow in a foreign land. The girl spoke up, "My mother says hello!" They spoke for several minutes while the girl translated. It was a pleasant conversation. A unique experience to converse with a Chinese speaker. </i></p>
    <p><i>They bid each other goodbye, and he turned to walk away. The little girl ran back to him. She had a message from her mother. It was an offer to pay him for tutoring services. She wanted her daughter to improve her English skills. He accepted the offer. There was a sense of purpose that came over him in that moment. </i> </p>
    <p><i>Shifting again, he found himself in a living room. It belonged to the little Chinese girl and her mother. He was sitting at a low table, tutoring the girl. She was an excellent student. Her mother had raised her well. She was respectful of elders and polite to everyone. </i> </p>
    <p><i>The mother watched them both and smiled. They shared meals together. He ate food he had never seen nor tasted. The girl helped him hold his chopsticks. He formed a bond with this family that stood in stark contrast to his home life. The feelings of accomplishment were undeniable. He was discovering a part of himself that he was previously unaware of. </i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>He woke abruptly from the dream. The room was bright with the morning sun. There was a feeling of disorientation. His head was pounding. <i>What just happened? </i> He looked around and realized he was still in the leather chair. The empty bottle and overturned glass hinted at his situation. He smelled his clothes. It was a terrible odor. </p>
    <p>He sat still in the chair and tried to keep the dream fresh in his mind. He felt as though part of him was still in the dream. He sat up straight. There was a need welling up in him to write it all down, before it disappeared. Then a more urgent need arose and he bolted to the bathroom to vomit.</p>
    <p>When the previous night finished purging itself from his body, he collapsed to the floor. Once again, he lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><i>He walked through the library with a sense of purpose. There were rows of books all around. A quiet murmur of people turning pages and the soft light filtering through the windows contributed to a sense of peace. He made his way to the table where she was waiting. </i></p>
    <p><i>They were both 7 years older now and had maintained a close relationship over the years. However, she was still a child while he had become a man. He had been tutoring her in algebra. She struggled to factor an equation. As always, he was quite patient with her. They worked through the problem together. Then the girl suddenly shifted the conversation. </i></p>
    <p><i>Her mother's health was declining. She was worried about what would happen when her mother was gone. He offered his sympathies, telling her that he would be there for her always. She thanked him and added that her mother was grateful for this and the good care he gave her. The implication was clear - her mother hoped that he would continue to do so even after she passed. </i></p>
    <p><i>As they continued to work through the algebra problem, he couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness creeping over him. He had become so attached to this girl and her mother, and the thought of losing them was almost unbearable. But he kept these feelings quiet, instead focusing on the math. </i></p>
    <p><i>Eventually, they finished the problem, and she smiled up at him. The tension in the room dissipated, and they fell into an easy conversation. They talked about their lives, their dreams, and their hopes for the future. As they talked, he became certain that he could handle whatever may come. </i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>When he woke again, his head was still throbbing with pain. He forced his eyes open trying to discern where he was. He recognized the shower rug. There was considerable confusion about what year it was. Gradually, he accepted he was in his apartment and on the bathroom floor. </p>
    <p>He hauled himself to his feet and began rummaging through the medicine cabinet for pain killers. Damn these childproof caps. He spilled two pills into the palm of his hand. <i>Nope! Not enough…</i> He dispensed two more. <i>That’ll do it. </i> They didn’t go down his throat without a fight. He fumbled for some water and drank with considerable relief.</p>
    <p>He stood in front of the sink for some time. Staring back at him from the mirror was a face he didn’t recognize. He knew it was his own – but he couldn’t feel it. <i>You look like hell. </i> He turned away navigating an uncertain course toward the bedroom. Without even the pretense of dignity, he removed his clothes and climbed under the blankets. </p>
    <p>The dreams began to flood back into his mind. <i>What does it mean? Who is making them? Could it be my own mind is telling itself a story? Or is it coming from some unknown outside source? </i> The mystery was too much for him to handle now. He pulled the blankets over his head to block the morning light and drifted back to sleep and into another dream. </p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><i>Initially confused, he realized he was in a church. The wedding march was playing, and people were looking at him expectantly. He glanced to his left and saw the little Chinese girl. She was all grown up and stunningly beautiful. She smiled at him and took his arm. He began to lead her down the aisle. </i></p>
    <p><i>He felt a sense of pride in that moment. He had come so far since he first met her in that classroom. He had taken on so many responsibilities, and he had not shrunk from them. He was proud of the man he had become. </i></p>
    <p><i>As they reached the altar, he took his seat and watched as the ceremony progressed. It was a strange feeling to be giving her away, but he knew that it was his duty. After all, she had no living family to do it for her. Watching from his seat, he began to reflect on his life up to this moment. How he came from a broken place. And what it meant for him to be welcomed into an immigrant family from a faraway land. It was the life he was meant to live. </i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Waking after noon, he was feeling better. Not great, just better. Better was fine for now, considering where he’d been. </p>
    <p>He made an effort to cancel the meetings that he hadn’t already missed. He was in no shape to do anything productive. After that he made some coffee. That helped a lot. He sipped from his cup and thought about the last 24 hours. He was irritated at himself for getting so out of control. <i>But the dreams… Where did they come from? </i> </p>
    <p>He sat in his leather chair, sipped his coffee and pondered the visions that had visited him in the night. They were vivid, almost too real to be mere figments of his imagination. He couldn't shake the feeling that they meant something. That they held a deeper truth he had yet to uncover.</p>
    <p>As he sat there, he felt a wistful longing wash over him. He wished he could go back to that classroom and actually meet that Chinese family. He wished he knew them in this life. Not just in his fantasy world. But he knew that was impossible.</p>
    <p>He rubbed his temples, trying to dispel the lingering headache from the night before. He took a walk. The fresh air cleared his head and gave him a new perspective. As he walked, he considered the possibility that the dreams were real. Maybe not from this world. Maybe from a different reality. A different time, perhaps. </p>
    <p>He felt uncertain about that. But he knew that the rent would be due, either way. That his project still had a deadline. That he had an actual life with actual responsibilities. And that this reality wasn’t going to change.</p>
    <p>With a deep sigh, he returned to his computer and got back to work. This was his life now. And the dreams… They were a life not lived.</p>
